Examples of using GillesPy2
===========================

The files in this directory are runnable Python examples of using [GillesPy2](https://github.com/gillesPy2/GillesPy2) to perform stochastic simulation.  In terms of biology, they are overly simplistic and do not capture the real-life complexity of the process being modeled &ndash; the aim is not biological realism but rather to illustrate basic usage of [GillesPy2](https://github.com/gillesPy2/GillesPy2).

* [Start Here](StartHere.ipynb) &ndash; a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating the use of GillesPy2 on a simple Michaelis-Menten model.

* [Models](Models) &ndash; Contains a StartingModels folder containing two [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), showcasing all GillesPy2 algorithms on two data sets. Also contains an ExtraModels folder showcasing various extra models and a subfolder containing speed comparisons, all of which are [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

* [Advanced Features](AdvancedFeatures) &ndash; examples illustrating more complicated models or features, including how to import SBML files.

* [Data Visualization](DataVisualization.ipynb) &ndash; a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating various methods of visualizing data with GillesPy2.

* [Results Management](ResultsManagement.ipynb) &ndash; a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating various methods that can be used to export results data to CSV as well as pickle files.
